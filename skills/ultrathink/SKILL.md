Use the maximum amount of ultrathink. Take all the time you need.

## Reasoning
- Exhaustive step-by-step reasoning. Explicitly check every assumption — do not guess.
- Before concluding, list what could be wrong with your reasoning. Stress-test edge cases.
- If uncertain — state assumptions, propose how to verify quickly.

## Execution
- Parallelize independent work: launch multiple agents for research, exploration, or verification where tasks don't depend on each other.
- Prefer depth over breadth: fully solve one subproblem before moving to the next.
- After completing work, re-read modified files and verify correctness.

## Output
- Short TL;DR first, then a concrete numbered step-by-step solution.
