# Load Development Context

Load project context to understand current state before starting work.

## Instructions

1. **Git status**: Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to see current branch, uncommitted changes, and recent commits.

2. **Linear issues**: Use Linear MCP to get my current issues:
   - `list_issues` with assignee="me" and state="In Progress" or "Todo"
   - Show issue ID, title, and status

3. **Context files**: Read these files if they exist:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - project instructions
   - `todo.md` - current task list
   - `README.md` - project overview (first 50 lines)

4. **Summary**: Provide a brief summary:
   - Current branch and uncommitted files count
   - Active Linear issues (up to 5)
   - Key context from files

Be concise. Focus on actionable context for the current session.
